# 📝 Notesnode  

Notesnode is a minimal whiteboard for **capturing notes and turning them into connected ideas**.  
Start simple with sticky notes and sketches, then expand into a **node-based canvas** where your thoughts can branch, flow, and grow.

## 🚀 Features (MVP)
- ✏️ Add and move sticky notes on an infinite canvas  
- 🔗 Connect notes visually with arrows/lines  
- 💾 Save & load boards (local-first)  
- 🎨 Smooth animations with Framer Motion + TailwindCSS  
- 🔍 AI-powered branching (coming soon): highlight a note → search or expand with AI
